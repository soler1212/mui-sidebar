# Sidebar Component

The sidebar behavior adapts based on screen size, toggling between a floating sidebar on smaller screens and a fixed sidebar on larger screens.

To see this in action, click the "Open" button to toggle the sidebar. Adjust the screen width to observe how the sidebar switches between the floating and fixed modes.
